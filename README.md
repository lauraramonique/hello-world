# hello-world


My name is Laura Monique and I'm quite the unique person. 
My childhood wasn't the easiest because of my abusive "Dad." 
I'm also a director and owner of Positive Celebrity Gossip magazine. 
It's also time to learn how to program. 

I am used to blogging and this has been so fun! I can't wait to learn more.
